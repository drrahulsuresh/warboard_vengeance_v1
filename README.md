# WarBoard: Vengeance

A fast tactical strategy prototype built in Python (Pygame). Pick countries, deploy tanks/troops/jets, place radar and AA, and launch missiles ‚Äî including **Anti-Radar (AR)** missiles that **cannot be intercepted**. The AI takes **one action per round** to keep turns fair and readable.

Features
- Country picker with summarized capabilities
- **Missile combat** with range preview and area effect (radius)
- **AR/ARM missiles** that bypass AA
- **Radar + AA**: radar reveals; AA intercepts missiles/jets **in radar coverage**
- **Market**: buy units and systems mid-battle; purchases add directly to inventory
- **One action per round** (you and AI): move one unit **or** fire one missile
- Simple, readable animations (missiles, unit movement, explosions)
